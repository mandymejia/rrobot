\title{Bootstrap-Based Outlier Detection via Multiple Imputation (MI_boot)}
\usage{
MI_boot(
  RD_org_obj,
  imp_datasets,
  B = 1000,
  alpha = 0.01,
  boot_quant = 0.95,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{RD_org_obj}{A list output from \code{comp_RD()} on the original hk_data.}

\item{imp_datasets}{A list of M numeric matrices (T × Q); multiply imputed datasets.}

\item{B}{Number of bootstrap samples per imputed dataset (default = 1000).}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for quantile thresholding (default = 0.01).}

\item{boot_quant}{Confidence level for CI (default = 0.95).}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if TRUE, prints progress.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{thresholds_all}{Vector of M×B thresholds from each bootstrap sample.}
\item{final_threshold}{Lower bound of CI across thresholds.}
\item{flagged_outliers}{Logical vector of outliers based on final threshold.}
}
}
\description{
Extends single imputation bootstrapping by using multiple imputation. For each of the M imputed datasets:
\itemize{
\item Generate B bootstrap samples (with replacement) from the included (non-outlier) indices
\item Compute robust distances (RD) for each sample
\item Extract the (1 - alpha) quantile of RD for each sample
}
}
\details{
This yields M × B threshold candidates. The lower bound of their (1 - boot_quant) confidence interval
is used as the final threshold. This is applied to the RD of the original data.
