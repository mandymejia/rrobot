\title{SHASH-based Outlier Detection with F-Distribution Thresholding}
\usage{
thresh_SHASH(x, cutoff = 4, quantile = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix or data frame of dimensions T Ã— Q.}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric; threshold multiplier for SHASH-based univariate outlier detection (default = 4).}

\item{quantile}{Numeric; quantile level for F-distribution threshold (default = 0.01).}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{c}{Consistency correction factor for robust distances.}
\item{m}{Estimated degrees of freedom parameter used in the F-distribution.}
\item{df}{A numeric vector of degrees of freedom: \code{c(df1, df2)}.}
\item{scale}{Scale factor for the threshold.}
\item{threshold}{Threshold for squared robust distances.}
\item{call}{The matched function call.}
}
}
\description{
Performs SHASH-based univariate outlier detection and applies F-distribution thresholding
using the SHASH-determined clean subset size.
}
\details{
This function implements a simple two-step process:
\enumerate{
\item Uses SHASH transformation with isolation forest to detect univariate outliers
\item Applies F-distribution thresholding using SHASH-determined clean subset size
}

The key difference from regular F-distribution thresholding is that h (the robust subset size)
is determined by SHASH outlier detection rather than MCD automatic selection.
