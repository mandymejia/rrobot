\title{Plot Robust Distances and HR Thresholds for One or Multiple Datasets}
\usage{
plot_RD(
  data_list,
  alpha = 0.01,
  HR = NULL,
  n_rep = 1000,
  label_map = NULL,
  binwidth = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_list}{A numeric matrix (T × Q), or a named list of such matrices. Each matrix should contain multivariate observations.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric in (0, 1). The quantile level used to compute the HR threshold via \code{\link{outlier_F}} if \code{HR} is not provided. Default is 0.01.}

\item{HR}{Optional numeric vector of threshold(s) for robust distances. If \code{NULL} (default), the threshold is computed via \code{\link{outlier_F}} for each dataset. If a single value is provided, it will be applied to all datasets. If a named vector is provided, names must match dataset names.}

\item{n_rep}{Integer. Number of repetitions used to estimate the mean false positive rate (FPR) by recomputing the RD and comparing to the threshold. Default is 1000.}

\item{label_map}{Optional named character vector to override facet labels. For example, \code{c("Gaussian" = "N(0,1)", "Skewed" = "Gamma(5,1)")} will relabel facet strips.}

\item{binwidth}{Bin width for the histogram of robust distances. Default is 0.1.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object that includes:
\itemize{
\item Histogram of robust distances by inclusion status (included vs. excluded)
\item Optional F-distribution density curve (if \code{HR} is \code{NULL})
\item Vertical dashed line for the supplied or computed threshold
\item FPR annotation per dataset panel
}
}
\description{
Generates histogram(s) of squared robust Mahalanobis distances computed from robust covariance estimates.
Overlays vertical threshold lines (e.g., HR threshold) and, optionally, F-distribution curves derived from Hotelling’s T² theory.
Works with either a single dataset or a list of datasets.
