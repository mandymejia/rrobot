\title{Extract high and low kurtosis ICA components using fMRIscrub}
\usage{
ICA_extract_kurt(time_series)
}
\arguments{
\item{time_series}{A numeric matrix of dimension T × V (time × variables), where each column is a univariate time series.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\describe{
\item{hk}{High-kurtosis ICA component matrix (T × K)}
\item{lk}{Low-kurtosis ICA component matrix (T × L)}
\item{highkurt}{Logical vector indicating which components are high-kurtosis}
}
}
\description{
This function performs ICA projection on a multivariate time series matrix using \code{pscrub()} from the
fMRIscrub package and separates high- and low-kurtosis components based on the
\code{highkurt} indicator.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
result <- ICA_extract_kurt(time_series = fMRIscrub::Dat1)
}
}
